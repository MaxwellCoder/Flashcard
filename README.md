# Flashcard App Project

A local school has decided to put together a flash card application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. 

Teachers will use this application to create decks of flash cards for the subjects that they teach, and students will study the decks. 

The school needs me to build the application that the students and teachers will use.A flashcard application for helping students study online.

Bootstrap 4 is included with the starter HTML. 

I was welcome to use vanilla CSS or Bootstrap 4 for styling your project.
However, my finished product had to match close enough to a provided mockup given by Thinkful
